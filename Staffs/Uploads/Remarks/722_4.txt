Dear Mr. John & Rozario,

As already discussed, with regarding to RegNo for CBSE Module, the database is structured in such a way that it will not allow alphabets and it will allow only the numeric characters to be stored in the database.

So, either we can add one more number in prefix in the regno for cbse school.

Eg : 
The format which is for School as of now is

  120150001
  220150002
  320150003
1320150004
1420150005

In the same way we can go for CBSE, additionally we can add 2 as a prefix for the CBSE module

Eg : 
The format which is for academy will be

  2120150001
  2220150002
  2320150003
21320150004
21420150005

The highlighted "2" will be the prefix and it can any number as your wish


Kindly check it and let me know

Regards
Pravin
